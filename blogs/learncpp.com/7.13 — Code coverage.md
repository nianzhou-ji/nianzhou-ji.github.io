In the previous lesson [7.12 -- Introduction to testing your code](https://www.learncpp.com/cpp-tutorial/introduction-to-testing-your-code/), we discussed how to write and preserve simple tests. In this lesson, we’ll talk about what kind of tests are useful to write to ensure your code is correct.

# Code coverage

The term **code coverage** is used to describe how much of the source code of a program is executed while testing. There are many different metrics used for code coverage. We’ll cover a few of the more useful and popular ones in the following sections.

# Statement coverage

The term **statement coverage** refers to the percentage of statements in your code that have been exercised by your testing routines.

Consider the following function:

```cpp
int foo(int x, int y)
{
    int z{ y };
    if (x > y)
    {
        z = x;
    }
    return z;
}
```

COPY

Calling this function as `foo(1, 0)` will give you complete statement coverage for this function, as every statement in the function will execute.

For our `isLowerVowel()` function:

```cpp
bool isLowerVowel(char c)
{
    switch (c) // statement 1
    {
    case 'a':
    case 'e':
    case 'i':
    case 'o':
    case 'u':
        return true; // statement 2
    default:
        return false; // statement 3
    }
}
```

COPY

This function will require two calls to test all of the statements, as there is no way to reach statement 2 and 3 in the same function call.

While aiming for 100% statement coverage is good, it’s not enough to ensure correctness.

# Branch coverage

**Branch coverage** refers to the percentage of branches that have been executed, each possible branch counted separately. An `if statement` has two branches -- a branch that executes when the condition is `true`, and a branch that executes when the condition is `false` (even if there is no corresponding `else statement` to execute). A switch statement can have many branches.

```cpp
int foo(int x, int y)
{
    int z{ y };
    if (x > y)
    {
        z = x;
    }
    return z;
}
```

COPY

The previous call to foo(1, 0) gave us 100% statement coverage and exercised the use case where `x > y`, but that only gives us 50% branch coverage. We need one more call, to `foo(0, 1)`, to test the use case where the `if statement` does not execute.

```cpp
bool isLowerVowel(char c)
{
    switch (c)
    {
    case 'a':
    case 'e':
    case 'i':
    case 'o':
    case 'u':
        return true;
    default:
        return false;
    }
}
```

COPY

In the isLowerVowel() function, two calls will be needed to give you 100% branch coverage: one (such as `isLowerVowel('a')`) to test the first cases, and another (such as `isLowerVowel('q')`) to test the default case. Multiple cases that feed into the same body don’t need to be tested separately -- if one works, they all should.

Now consider the following function:

```cpp
void compare(int x, int y)
{
	if (x > y)
		std::cout << x << " is greater than " << y << '\n'; // case 1
	else if (x < y)
		std::cout << x << " is less than " << y << '\n'; // case 2
	else
		std::cout << x << " is equal to " << y << '\n'; // case 3
}
```

COPY

3 calls are needed to get 100% branch coverage here: `compare(1, 0)` tests the positive use case for the first `if statement`. `compare(0, 1)` tests the negative use case for the first `if statement` and the positive use case for the second `if statement`. `compare(0, 0)` tests the negative use case for the first and second `if statement` and executes the `else statement`. Thus, we can say this function is reliably tested with 3 calls (which is slightly better than 18 quintillion).

> Aim for 100% branch coverage of your code.

# Loop coverage

**Loop coverage** (informally called **the 0, 1, 2 test**) says that if you have a loop in your code, you should ensure it works properly when it iterates 0 times, 1 time, and 2 times. If it works correctly for the 2-iteration case, it should work correctly for all iterations greater than 2. These three tests therefore cover all possibilities (since a loop can’t execute a negative number of times).

Consider:

```cpp
#include <iostream>

void spam(int timesToPrint)
{
    for (int count{ 0 }; count < timesToPrint; ++count)
         std::cout << "Spam! ";
}
```

COPY

To test the loop within this function properly, you should call it three times: `spam(0)` to test the zero-iteration case, `spam(1)` to test the one-iteration case, and `spam(2)` to test the two-iteration case. If `spam(2)` works, then `spam(n)` should work, where `n > 2`.

> **Best practice**
>
> Use the `0, 1, 2 test` to ensure your loops work correctly with different number of iterations.

# Testing different categories of input

When writing functions that accept parameters, or when accepting user input, consider what happens with different categories of input. In this context, we’re using the term “category” to mean a set of inputs that have similar characteristics.

For example, if I wrote a function to produce the square root of an integer, what values would it make sense to test it with? You’d probably start with some normal value, like `4`. But it would also be a good idea to test with `0`, and a negative number.

Here are some basic guidelines for category testing:

For integers, make sure you’ve considered how your function handles negative values, zero, and positive values. You should also check for overflow if that’s relevant.

For floating point numbers, make sure you’ve considered how your function handles values that have precision issues (values that are slightly larger or smaller than expected). Good `double` type values to test with are `0.1` and `-0.1` (to test numbers that are slightly larger than expected) and `0.6` and `-0.6` (to test numbers that are slightly smaller than expected).

For strings, make sure you’ve considered how your function handles an empty string (just a null terminator), normal valid strings, strings that have whitespace, and strings that are all whitespace.

If your function takes a pointer, don’t forget to test `nullptr` as well (don’t worry if this doesn’t make sense, we haven’t covered it yet).
