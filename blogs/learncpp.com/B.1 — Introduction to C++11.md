**What is C++11?**

On August 12, 2011, the [ISO (International Organization for Standardization)](https://www.iso.org/home.html) approved a new version of C++, called C++11. C++11 adds a whole new set of features to the C++ language! Use of these new features is entirely optional -- but you will undoubtedly find some of them helpful. The prior tutorials have all been updated to be C++11 compliant.

**The goals and designs of C++11**

Bjarne Stroustrup characterized the goals of C++11 as such:

- Build on C++’s strengths -- rather than trying to extend C++ to new areas where it may be weaker (eg. Windows applications with heavy GUI), focus on making it do what it does well even better.
- Make C++ easier to learn, use, and teach -- provide functionality that makes the language more consistent and easier to use.

To that end, the committee that put the language together tried to obey the following general principles:

- Maintain stability and compatibility with older versions of C++ and C wherever possible. Programs that worked under C++03 should generally still work under C++11.
- Keep the number of core language extensions to a minimum, and put the bulk of the changes in the standard library (an objective that wasn’t met very well with this release)
- Focus on improving abstraction mechanisms (classes, templates) rather than adding mechanisms to handle specific, narrow situations.
- Add new functionality for both novices and experts. A little of something for everybody!
- Increase type safety, to prevent inadvertent bugs.
- Improve performance and allow C++ to work directly with hardware.
- Consider usability and ecosystem issues. C++ needs to work well with other tools, be easy to use and teach, etc…

C++11 isn’t a large departure from C++03 thematically, but it did add a huge amount of new functionality.

**Major new features in C++11**

For your interest, here’s a list of the major features that C++11 adds. Note that this list is not comprehensive, but rather intended to highlight some of the key features of interest.
