In previous lessons, we’ve talked at length about fixed and dynamic arrays. Although both are built right into the C++ language, they both have downsides: ==Fixed arrays decay into pointers, losing the array length information when they do==, and dynamic arrays have messy deallocation issues and are challenging to resize without error.

To address these issues, the C++ standard library includes functionality that makes array management easier, `std::array` and `std::vector`. We’ll examine `std::array` in this lesson, and `std::vector` in the next.

# An introduction to std::array

`std::array` provides fixed array functionality that won’t decay when passed into a function. `std::array` is defined in the `<array>` header, inside the `std` namespace.

Declaring a `std::array` variable is easy:

```cpp
#include <array>

std::array<int, 3> myArray; // declare an integer array with length 3
```

COPY

Just like the native implementation of fixed arrays, the length of a `std::array` must be known at compile time.



`std::array` can be initialized using initializer lists or list initialization:

```cpp
std::array<int, 5> myArray = { 9, 7, 5, 3, 1 }; // initializer list
std::array<int, 5> myArray2 { 9, 7, 5, 3, 1 }; // list initialization
```

COPY

Unlike built-in fixed arrays, with std::array you can not omit the array length when providing an initializer:

```cpp
std::array<int, > myArray { 9, 7, 5, 3, 1 }; // illegal, array length must be provided
std::array<int> myArray { 9, 7, 5, 3, 1 }; // illegal, array length must be provided
```

COPY

However, since C++17, it is allowed to omit the type and size. They can only be omitted together, but not one or the other, and only if the array is explicitly initialized.

```cpp
std::array myArray { 9, 7, 5, 3, 1 }; // The type is deduced to std::array<int, 5>
std::array myArray { 9.7, 7.31 }; // The type is deduced to std::array<double, 2>
```

COPY

We favor this syntax rather than typing out the type and size at the declaration. If your compiler is not C++17 capable, you need to use the explicit syntax instead.

```cpp
// std::array myArray { 9, 7, 5, 3, 1 }; // Since C++17
std::array<int, 5> myArray { 9, 7, 5, 3, 1 }; // Before C++17

// std::array myArray { 9.7, 7.31 }; // Since C++17
std::array<double, 2> myArray { 9.7, 7.31 }; // Before C++17
```

COPY

Since C++20, it is possible to specify the element type but omit the array length. This makes creation of `std::array` a little more like creation of C-style arrays. To create an array with a specific type and deduced size, we use the `std::to_array` function:

```cpp
auto myArray1 { std::to_array<int, 5>({ 9, 7, 5, 3, 1 }) }; // Specify type and size
auto myArray2 { std::to_array<int>({ 9, 7, 5, 3, 1 }) }; // Specify type only, deduce size
auto myArray3 { std::to_array({ 9, 7, 5, 3, 1 }) }; // Deduce type and size
```

COPY

Unfortunately, `std::to_array` is more expensive than creating a `std::array` directly, because it actually copies all elements from a C-style array to a `std::array`. For this reason, `std::to_array` should be avoided when the array is created many times (e.g. in a loop).

You can also assign values to the array using an initializer list

```cpp
std::array<int, 5> myArray;
myArray = { 0, 1, 2, 3, 4 }; // okay
myArray = { 9, 8, 7 }; // okay, elements 3 and 4 are set to zero!
myArray = { 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5 }; // not allowed, too many elements in initializer list!
```

COPY

Accessing `std::array` values using the subscript operator works just like you would expect:

```cpp
std::cout << myArray[1] << '\n';
myArray[2] = 6;
```

COPY

Just like built-in fixed arrays, the subscript operator does not do any bounds-checking. If an invalid index is provided, bad things will probably happen.

`std::array` supports a second form of array element access (the `at()` function) that does (runtime) bounds checking:



```cpp
std::array myArray { 9, 7, 5, 3, 1 };
myArray.at(1) = 6; // array element 1 is valid, sets array element 1 to value 6
myArray.at(9) = 10; // array element 9 is invalid, will throw a runtime error
```

COPY

In the above example, the call to `myArray.at(1)` checks to ensure the index 1 is valid, and because it is, it returns a reference to array element 1. We then assign the value of 6 to this. However, the call to `myArray.at(9)` fails (at runtime) because array element 9 is out of bounds for the array. Instead of returning a reference, the `at()` function throws an error that terminates the program (note: It’s actually throwing an exception of type `std::out_of_range` -- we cover exceptions in chapter 14). Because it does bounds checking, `at()` is slower (but safer) than `operator[]`.

`std::array` will clean up after itself when it goes out of scope, so there’s no need to do any kind of manual cleanup.

# Size and sorting

The `size()` function can be used to retrieve the length of the `std::array`:

```cpp
std::array myArray { 9.0, 7.2, 5.4, 3.6, 1.8 };
std::cout << "length: " << myArray.size() << '\n';
```

COPY

This prints:

```
length: 5
```

Because `std::array` doesn’t decay to a pointer when passed to a function, the `size()` function will work even if you call it from within a function:

```cpp
#include <array>
#include <iostream>

void printLength(const std::array<double, 5>& myArray)
{
    std::cout << "length: " << myArray.size() << '\n';
}

int main()
{
    std::array myArray { 9.0, 7.2, 5.4, 3.6, 1.8 };

    printLength(myArray);

    return 0;
}
```

COPY

This also prints:

```
length: 5
```

Note that the standard library uses the term “size” to mean the array length — do not get this confused with the results of `sizeof()` on a native fixed array, which returns the actual size of the array in memory (the size of an element multiplied by the array length). Yes, this nomenclature is inconsistent.

Also note that we passed `std::array` by (`const`) reference. This is to prevent the compiler from making a copy of the `std::array` when the `std::array` was passed to the function (for performance reasons).

> ==**Best practice**==
>
> ==Always pass `std::array` by reference or `const` reference==

Because the length is always known, range-based for-loops work with `std::array`:

```cpp
std::array myArray{ 9, 7, 5, 3, 1 };

for (int element : myArray)
    std::cout << element << ' ';
```

COPY

You can sort `std::array` using `std::sort`, which lives in the `<algorithm>` header:

```cpp
#include <algorithm> // for std::sort
#include <array>
#include <iostream>

int main()
{
    std::array myArray { 7, 3, 1, 9, 5 };
    std::sort(myArray.begin(), myArray.end()); // sort the array forwards
//  std::sort(myArray.rbegin(), myArray.rend()); // sort the array backwards

    for (int element : myArray)
        std::cout << element << ' ';

    std::cout << '\n';

    return 0;
}
```

COPY

This prints:

```
1 3 5 7 9
```

# Passing std::array of different lengths to a function



With a std::array, the element type and array length are part of the type information. ==Therefore, when we use a std::array as a function parameter, we have to specify the element type and array length:==

```cpp
#include <array>
#include <iostream>

void printArray(const std::array<int, 5>& myArray)
{
    for (auto element : myArray)
        std::cout << element << ' ';
    std::cout << '\n';
}

int main()
{
    std::array myArray5{ 9.0, 7.2, 5.4, 3.6, 1.8 }; // type deduced as std::array<double, 5>
    printArray(myArray5); // error: printArray expects a std::array<int, 5>

    return 0;
}
```

COPY

The downside is that this limits our function to only handling arrays of this specific type and length. But what if we want to have our function handle arrays of different element types or lengths? We’d have to create a copy of the function for each different element type and/or array length we want to use. That’s a lot of duplication.

Fortunately, we can have C++ do this for us, using templates. We can create a template function that parameterizes part or all of the type information, and then C++ will use that template to create “real” functions (with actual types) as needed.

```cpp
#include <array>
#include <cstddef>
#include <iostream>

// printArray is a template function
template <typename T, std::size_t size> // parameterize the element type and size
void printArray(const std::array<T, size>& myArray)
{
    for (auto element : myArray)
        std::cout << element << ' ';
    std::cout << '\n';
}

int main()
{
    std::array myArray5{ 9.0, 7.2, 5.4, 3.6, 1.8 };
    printArray(myArray5);

    std::array myArray7{ 9.0, 7.2, 5.4, 3.6, 1.8, 1.2, 0.7 };
    printArray(myArray7);

    return 0;
}
```

# Manually indexing std::array via size_type

Pop quiz: What’s wrong with the following code?



```cpp
#include <iostream>
#include <array>

int main()
{
    std::array myArray { 7, 3, 1, 9, 5 };

    // Iterate through the array and print the value of the elements
    for (int i{ 0 }; i < myArray.size(); ++i)
        std::cout << myArray[i] << ' ';

    std::cout << '\n';

    return 0;
}
```

COPY

The answer is that there’s a likely signed/unsigned mismatch in this code! Due to a curious decision, the `size()` function and array index parameter to `operator[]` use a type called `size_type`, which is defined by the C++ standard as an *unsigned* integral type. Our loop counter/index (variable `i`) is a `signed int`. Therefore both the comparison `i < myArray.size()` and the array index `myArray[i]` have type mismatches.

Interestingly enough, `size_type` isn’t a global type (like `int` or `std::size_t`). Rather, it’s defined inside the definition of `std::array` (C++ allows nested types). This means when we want to use `size_type`, we have to prefix it with the full array type (think of `std::array` acting as a namespace in this regard). In our above example, the fully-prefixed type of “size_type” is `std::array<int, 5>::size_type`!

Therefore, the correct way to write the above code is as follows:

```cpp
#include <array>
#include <iostream>

int main()
{
    std::array myArray { 7, 3, 1, 9, 5 };

    // std::array<int, 5>::size_type is the return type of size()!
    for (std::array<int, 5>::size_type i{ 0 }; i < myArray.size(); ++i)
        std::cout << myArray[i] << ' ';

    std::cout << '\n';

    return 0;
}
```

COPY

That’s not very readable. Fortunately, `std::array::size_type` is just an alias for `std::size_t`, so we can use that instead.

```cpp
#include <array>
#include <cstddef> // std::size_t
#include <iostream>

int main()
{
    std::array myArray { 7, 3, 1, 9, 5 };

    for (std::size_t i{ 0 }; i < myArray.size(); ++i)
        std::cout << myArray[i] << ' ';

    std::cout << '\n';

    return 0;
}
```

COPY

A better solution is to avoid manual indexing of `std::array` in the first place. Instead, use range-based for-loops (or iterators) if possible.



Keep in mind that unsigned integers wrap around when you reach their limits. A common mistake is to decrement an index that is 0 already, causing a wrap-around to the maximum value. You saw this in the lesson about for-loops, but let’s repeat.

```cpp
#include <array>
#include <iostream>

int main()
{
    std::array myArray { 7, 3, 1, 9, 5 };

    // Print the array in reverse order.
    // We can use auto, because we're not initializing i with 0.
    // Bad:
    for (auto i{ myArray.size() - 1 }; i >= 0; --i)
        std::cout << myArray[i] << ' ';

    std::cout << '\n';

    return 0;
}
```

COPY

This is an infinite loop, producing undefined behavior once `i` wraps around. There are two issues here. If `myArray` is empty, i.e. `size()` returns 0 (which is possible with `std::array`), `myArray.size() - 1` wraps around. The other issue occurs no matter how many elements there are. `i >= 0` is always true, because unsigned integers cannot be less than 0.

A working reverse for-loop for unsigned integers takes an odd shape:

```cpp
#include <array>
#include <iostream>

int main()
{
    std::array myArray { 7, 3, 1, 9, 5 };

    // Print the array in reverse order.
    for (auto i{ myArray.size() }; i-- > 0; )
        std::cout << myArray[i] << ' ';

    std::cout << '\n';

    return 0;
}
```

COPY

Suddenly we decrement the index in the condition, and we use the postfix `--` operator. The condition runs before every iteration, including the first. In the first iteration, `i` is `myArray.size() - 1`, because `i` was decremented in the condition. When `i` is 0 and about to wrap around, the condition is no longer `true` and the loop stops. `i` actually wraps around when we do `i--` for the last time, but it’s not used afterwards.

# Array of struct 

Of course `std::array` isn’t limited to numbers as elements. Every type that can be used in a regular array can be used in a `std::array`. For example, we can have a `std::array` of struct:

```cpp
#include <array>
#include <iostream>

struct House
{
    int number{};
    int stories{};
    int roomsPerStory{};
};

int main()
{
    std::array<House, 3> houses{};

    houses[0] = { 13, 4, 30 };
    houses[1] = { 14, 3, 10 };
    houses[2] = { 15, 3, 40 };

    for (const auto& house : houses)
    {
        std::cout << "House number " << house.number
                  << " has " << (house.stories * house.roomsPerStory)
                  << " rooms\n";
    }

    return 0;
}
```

COPY

The above outputs the following:

```
House number 13 has 120 rooms
House number 14 has 30 rooms
House number 15 has 120 rooms
```

However, things get a little weird when we try to initialize an array whose element type requires a list of values (such as a `std::array` of struct). You might try to initialize such a `std::array` like this:

```cpp
// Doesn't work.
std::array<House, 3> houses {
    { 13, 4, 30 },
    { 14, 3, 10 },
    { 15, 3, 40 }
};
```

COPY

But this doesn’t work.

A `std::array` is defined as a struct that contains a C-style array member (whose name is implementation defined). So when we try to initialize `houses` per the above, the compiler interprets the initialization like this:

```cpp
// Doesn't work.
std::array<House, 3> houses { // initializer for houses
    { 13, 4, 30 }, // initializer for the C-style array member inside the std::array struct
    { 14, 3, 10 }, // ?
    { 15, 3, 40 }  // ?
};
```

COPY

The compiler will interpret `{ 13, 4, 30 }` as the initializer for the entire array. This has the effect of initializing the struct with index 0 with those values, and zero-initializing the rest of the struct elements. Then the compiler will discover we’ve provided two more initialization values (`{ 14, 3, 10 }` and `{ 15, 3, 40 }`) and produce a compilation error telling us that we’ve provided too many initialization values.

The correct way to initialize the above is to add an extra set of braces as follows:

```cpp
// This works as expected
std::array<House, 3> houses { // initializer for houses
    { // extra set of braces to initialize the C-style array member inside the std::array struct
        { 13, 4, 30 }, // initializer for array element 0
        { 14, 3, 10 }, // initializer for array element 1
        { 15, 3, 40 }, // initializer for array element 2
     }
};
```

COPY

Note the extra set of braces that are required (to begin initialization of the C-style array member inside the std::array struct). Within those braces, we can then initialize each element individually, each inside its own set of braces.

This is why you’ll see `std::array` initializers with an extra set of braces when the element type requires a list of values.

# Summary

`std::array` is a great replacement for built-in fixed arrays. It’s efficient, in that it doesn’t use any more memory than built-in fixed arrays. The only real downside of a `std::array` over a built-in fixed array is a slightly more awkward syntax, that you have to explicitly specify the array length (the compiler won’t calculate it for you from the initializer, unless you also omit the type, which isn’t always possible), and the signed/unsigned issues with size and indexing. But those are comparatively minor quibbles — we recommend using `std::array` over built-in fixed arrays for any non-trivial array use.
