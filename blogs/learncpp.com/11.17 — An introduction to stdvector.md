In the previous lesson, we introduced `std::array`, which provides the functionality of C++’s built-in fixed arrays in a safer and more usable form.

Analogously, the C++ standard library provides functionality that makes working with dynamic arrays safer and easier. This functionality is named `std::vector`.

Unlike `std::array`, which closely follows the basic functionality of fixed arrays, `std::vector` comes with some additional tricks up its sleeves. These help make `std::vector` one of the most useful and versatile tools to have in your C++ toolkit.

# An introduction to std::vector

Introduced in C++03, `std::vector` provides dynamic array functionality that handles its own memory management. This means you can create arrays that have their length set at run-time, without having to explicitly allocate and deallocate memory using `new` and `delete`. `std::vector` lives in the `<vector>` header.

Declaring a `std::vector` is simple:



```cpp
#include <vector>

// no need to specify length at the declaration
std::vector<int> array;
std::vector<int> array2 = { 9, 7, 5, 3, 1 }; // use initializer list to initialize array (before C++11)
std::vector<int> array3 { 9, 7, 5, 3, 1 }; // use uniform initialization to initialize array

// as with std::array, the type can be omitted since C++17
std::vector array4 { 9, 7, 5, 3, 1 }; // deduced to std::vector<int>
```

COPY

Note that in both the uninitialized and initialized case, you do not need to include the array length at compile time. This is because `std::vector` will dynamically allocate memory for its contents as requested.

Just like `std::array`, accessing array elements can be done via the `[]` operator (which does no bounds checking) or the `at()` function (which does bounds checking):

```cpp
array[6] = 2; // no bounds checking
array.at(7) = 3; // does bounds checking
```

COPY

In either case, if you request an element that is off the end of the array, the vector will *not* automatically resize.

As of C++11, you can also assign values to a `std::vector` using an initializer-list:

```cpp
array = { 0, 1, 2, 3, 4 }; // okay, array length is now 5
array = { 9, 8, 7 }; // okay, array length is now 3
```

COPY

In this case, the vector will self-resize to match the number of elements provided.

# Self-cleanup prevents memory leaks

When a vector variable goes out of scope, it automatically deallocates the memory it controls (if necessary). This is not only handy (as you don’t have to do it yourself), it also helps prevent memory leaks. Consider the following snippet:

```cpp
void doSomething(bool earlyExit)
{
    int* array{ new int[5] { 9, 7, 5, 3, 1 } }; // allocated memory using new

    if (earlyExit)
        return; // exits the function without deallocating the memory allocated above

    // do stuff here

    delete[] array; // never called
}
```

COPY

If earlyExit is set to true, array will never be deallocated, and the memory will be leaked.

However, if `array` is a `std::vector`, this won’t happen, because the memory will be deallocated as soon as `array` goes out of scope (regardless of whether the function exits early or not). This makes `std::vector` much safer to use than doing your own memory allocation.

# Vectors remember their length

Unlike built-in dynamic arrays, which don’t know the length of the array they are pointing to, std::vector keeps track of its length. We can ask for the vector’s length via the `size()` function:

```cpp
#include <iostream>
#include <vector>

void printLength(const std::vector<int>& array)
{
    std::cout << "The length is: " << array.size() << '\n';
}

int main()
{
    std::vector array { 9, 7, 5, 3, 1 };
    printLength(array);

    std::vector<int> empty {};
    printLength(empty);

    return 0;
}
```

COPY

The above example prints:

```
The length is: 5
The length is: 0
```

Just like with `std::array`, `size()` returns a value of nested type `size_type` (full type in the above example would be `std::vector<int>::size_type`), which is an unsigned integer.



# Resizing a vector

Resizing a built-in dynamically allocated array is complicated. Resizing a `std::vector` is as simple as calling the `resize()` function:

```cpp
#include <iostream>
#include <vector>

int main()
{
    std::vector array { 0, 1, 2 };
    array.resize(5); // set size to 5

    std::cout << "The length is: " << array.size() << '\n';

    for (int i : array)
        std::cout << i << ' ';

    std::cout << '\n';

    return 0;
}
```

COPY

This prints:

```
The length is: 5
0 1 2 0 0
```

There are two things to note here. First, when we resized the vector, the existing element values were preserved! Second, new elements are initialized to the default value for the type (which is 0 for integers).

Vectors may be resized to be smaller:

```cpp
#include <vector>
#include <iostream>

int main()
{
    std::vector array { 0, 1, 2, 3, 4 };
    array.resize(3); // set length to 3

    std::cout << "The length is: " << array.size() << '\n';

    for (int i : array)
        std::cout << i << ' ';

    std::cout << '\n';

    return 0;
}
```

COPY

This prints:

```
The length is: 3
0 1 2
```

# Initializing a vector to a specific size

Resizing a vector is computationally expensive, so you should strive to minimize the number of times you do so. If you need a vector with a specific number of elements but don’t know the values of the elements at the point of declaration, you can create a vector with default elements like so:



```cpp
#include <iostream>
#include <vector>

int main()
{
    // Using direct initialization, we can create a vector with 5 elements,
    // each element is a 0. If we use brace initialization, the vector would
    // have 1 element, a 5.
    std::vector<int> array(5);

    std::cout << "The length is: " << array.size() << '\n';

    for (int i : array)
        std::cout << i << ' ';

    std::cout << '\n';

    return 0;
}
```

COPY

This prints:

```
The length is: 5
0 0 0 0 0
```

> We’ll talk about why direct and brace-initialization are treated differently in lesson [16.7 -- std::initializer_list](https://www.learncpp.com/cpp-tutorial/stdinitializer_list/). As a rule of thumb, if a type is some kind of list, and you don’t want to initialize the object with a list of values, use direct initialization.

# Compacting bools

`std::vector` has another cool trick up its sleeves. There is a special implementation for `std::vector` of type bool that will compact 8 booleans into a byte! This happens behind the scenes, and doesn’t change how you use the std::vector.

```cpp
#include <vector>
#include <iostream>

int main()
{
    std::vector<bool> array { true, false, false, true, true };
    std::cout << "The length is: " << array.size() << '\n';

    for (int i : array)
        std::cout << i << ' ';

    std::cout << '\n';

    return 0;
}
```

COPY

This prints:

```
The length is: 5
1 0 0 1 1
```

# More to come

Note that this is an introduction article intended to introduce the basics of `std::vector`. In lesson [12.3 -- std::vector capacity and stack behavior](https://www.learncpp.com/cpp-tutorial/stdvector-capacity-and-stack-behavior/), we’ll cover some additional capabilities of `std::vector`, including the difference between a vector’s length and capacity, and take a deeper look into how `std::vector` handles memory allocation.

# Conclusion

Because variables of type `std::vector` handle their own memory management (which helps prevent memory leaks), remember their length, and can be easily resized, we recommend using `std::vector` in most cases where dynamic arrays are needed.
