> Some of the content of this lesson was moved into the introduction to std::string_view lesson ([4.18 -- Introduction to std::string_view](https://www.learncpp.com/cpp-tutorial/introduction-to-stdstring_view/)). As a result, this lesson contains some duplicative content that has not been cleaned up yet. This will be addressed when this chapter is rewritten (soon).

In the previous lesson, we talked about C-style strings, and the dangers of using them. C-style strings are fast, but they’re not as easy to use and as safe as `std::string`.

But `std::string` (which we covered in lesson [4.17 -- Introduction to std::string](https://www.learncpp.com/cpp-tutorial/introduction-to-stdstring/)), has some of its own downsides, particularly when it comes to const strings.



Consider the following example:

```cpp
#include <iostream>
#include <string>

int main()
{
  char text[]{ "hello" };
  std::string str{ text };
  std::string more{ str };

  std::cout << text << ' ' << str << ' ' << more << '\n';

  return 0;
}
```

COPY

As expected, this prints

```
hello hello hello
```

Internally, `main` copies the string “hello” 3 times, resulting in 4 copies. First, there is the string literal “hello”, which is known at compile-time and stored in the binary. One copy is created when we create the `char[]`. The following two `std::string` objects create one copy of the string each.

So why does `std::string` make a copy of the string used to initialize it? A `std::string` provides some useful guarantees about the string data it manages:

- The string data will be valid for as long as the string object is alive, and cleaned up when the string object dies.
- The string’s value can only be modified by the string object.
- The string’s value can be modified without affecting other objects (for non-const strings).

A `std::string` object has no control over what kind of string is used to initialize it (that is the caller’s responsibility) -- the caller could destroy or modify the initialization string immediately after the `std::string` object is initialized. Post-initialization, the string object can not rely on the initializer in any way, otherwise the above guarantees could be violated.

By making a copy of the initialization string (that only it has access to), the string object can ensure that the value and lifetime of the string data is independent from other objects (including the initialization string).

However, in some cases, we don’t need these benefits (particularly for const `std::string` objects, which can’t modify their value). Consider the case where we we know a `std::string` won’t outlive it’s initialization string, and that the initialization string won’t be modified. In such cases, we’re paying a high cost (making a copy of the initialization string) for benefits we don’t need (independence from the initialization string).

# Introducing std::string_view

Consider a window in your house, looking at a car sitting on the street. You can look through the window and see the car, but you can’t touch or move the car. Your window just provides a view to the car, which is a completely separate object.

C++17 introduces another way of using strings, `std::string_view`, which lives in the <string_view> header.

Unlike `std::string`, which keeps its own copy of the string, `std::string_view` provides a *view* of a string that is defined elsewhere.

We can re-write the above code to use `std::string_view` by replacing every `std::string` and `C-style string` with `std::string_view`.

```cpp
#include <iostream>
#include <string_view>

int main()
{
  std::string_view text{ "hello" }; // view the text "hello", which is stored in the binary
  std::string_view str{ text }; // view of the same "hello"
  std::string_view more{ str }; // view of the same "hello"

  std::cout << text << ' ' << str << ' ' << more << '\n';

  return 0;
}
```

COPY

The output is the same, but no more copies of the string “hello” are created. The string “hello” is stored in the binary and is not allocated at run-time. `text` is only a view onto the string “hello”, so no copy has to be created. When we copy a `std::string_view`, the new `std::string_view` observes the same string as the copied-from `std::string_view` is observing. This means that neither `str` nor `more` create any copies of the string. They are views onto the existing string “hello”.

`std::string_view` is not only fast, but has many of the functions that we know from `std::string`.

```cpp
#include <iostream>
#include <string_view>

int main()
{
  std::string_view str{ "Trains are fast!" };

  std::cout << str.length() << '\n'; // 16
  std::cout << str.substr(0, str.find(' ')) << '\n'; // Trains
  std::cout << (str == "Trains are fast!") << '\n'; // 1

  // Since C++20
  std::cout << str.starts_with("Boats") << '\n'; // 0
  std::cout << str.ends_with("fast!") << '\n'; // 1

  std::cout << str << '\n'; // Trains are fast!

  return 0;
}
```

COPY

Because `std::string_view` doesn’t create a copy of the string, if we change the viewed string, the changes are reflected in the `std::string_view`.

```cpp
#include <iostream>
#include <string_view>

int main()
{
  char arr[]{ "Gold" };
  std::string_view str{ arr };

  std::cout << str << '\n'; // Gold

  // Change 'd' to 'f' in arr
  arr[3] = 'f';

  std::cout << str << '\n'; // Golf

  return 0;
}
```

COPY

We modified `arr`, but `str` appears to be changing as well. That’s because `arr` and `str` share their string. When you use a `std::string_view`, it’s best to avoid modifications to the underlying string for the remainder of the `std::string_view`‘s life to prevent confusion and errors.

> **Best practice**
>
> Prefer `std::string_view` over `std::string` and C-style strings when you only need read-only access to a string (unless you can’t guarantee the string being viewed will stay alive for the lifetime of the `std::string_view`, in which case you should prefer `std::string`).

# View modification functions

Back to our window analogy, consider a window with curtains. We can close either the left or right curtain to reduce what we can see. We don’t change what’s outside, we just reduce the visible area.

Similarly, `std::string_view` contains functions that let us manipulate the *view* of the string. This allows us to change the view without modifying the viewed string.

The functions for this are `remove_prefix`, which removes characters from the left side of the view, and `remove_suffix`, which removes characters from the right side of the view.

```cpp
#include <iostream>
#include <string_view>

int main()
{
  std::string_view str{ "Peach" };

  std::cout << str << '\n';

  // Ignore the first character.
  str.remove_prefix(1);

  std::cout << str << '\n';

  // Ignore the last 2 characters.
  str.remove_suffix(2);

  std::cout << str << '\n';

  return 0;
}
```

COPY

This program produces the following output:

```
Peach
each
ea
```

Unlike real curtains, a `std::string_view` cannot be opened back up. Once you shrink the area, the only way to re-widen it is to reset the view by reassigning the source string to it again.

# std::string_view works with non-null-terminated strings

Unlike C-style strings and `std::string`, `std::string_view` doesn’t use null terminators to mark the end of the string. Rather, it knows where the string ends because it keeps track of its length.

```cpp
#include <iostream>
#include <iterator> // For std::size
#include <string_view>

int main()
{
  // No null-terminator.
  char vowels[]{ 'a', 'e', 'i', 'o', 'u' };

  // vowels isn't null-terminated. We need to pass the length manually.
  // Because vowels is an array, we can use std::size to get its length.
  std::string_view str{ vowels, std::size(vowels) };

  std::cout << str << '\n'; // This is safe. std::cout knows how to print std::string_view.

  return 0;
}
```

COPY

This program prints:

```
aeiou
```

# Converting a `std::string_view` to a C-style string

Some old functions (such as the old strlen function) still expect C-style strings. To convert a `std::string_view` to a C-style string, we can do so by first converting to a `std::string`:

```cpp
#include <cstring>
#include <iostream>
#include <string>
#include <string_view>

int main()
{
  std::string_view sv{ "balloon" };

  sv.remove_suffix(3);

  // Create a std::string from the std::string_view
  std::string str{ sv };

  // Get the null-terminated C-style string.
  auto szNullTerminated{ str.c_str() };

  // Pass the null-terminated string to the function that we want to use.
  std::cout << str << " has " << std::strlen(szNullTerminated) << " letter(s)\n";

  return 0;
}
```

COPY

This prints:

```
ball has 4 letter(s)
```

However, creating a `std::string` every time we want to pass a `std::string_view` as a C-style string is expensive, so this should be avoided if possible.

# Passing strings by const std::string& or std::string_view?

One question that often comes up: is it better to pass strings by `const std::string&` or `std::string_view`?

If we want to write a function that takes a string parameter, making the parameter a `std::string_view` is the most flexible choice, because it can work efficiently with C-style string arguments (including string literals), `std::string` arguments (which will implicitly convert to `std::string_view`), and `std::string_view` arguments:

```cpp
#include <iostream>
#include <string>
#include <string_view>

void printSV(std::string_view sv)
{
    std::cout << sv << '\n';
}

int main()
{
    std::string s{ "Hello, world" };
    std::string_view sv { s };

    printSV(s);              // ok: pass std::string
    printSV(sv);             // ok: pass std::string_view
    printSV("Hello, world"); // ok: pass C-style string literal

    return 0;
}
```

COPY

Note that we pass `std::string_view` by value instead of by const reference. This is because `std::string_view` is typically fast to copy, and pass by value is optimal for cheap to copy types.

There is one case where making the parameter a `const std::string&` is generally better: if your function needs to call some other function that takes a C-style string or `std::string` parameter, then `const std::string&` may be a better choice, as `std::string_view` is not guaranteed to be null-terminated (something that C-style string functions expect) and does not efficiently convert back to a std::string.

> **Best practice**
>
> Prefer passing strings using `std::string_view` (by value) instead of `const std::string&`, unless your function calls other functions that require C-style strings or std::string parameters.

> **Author’s note**
>
> Many examples in future lessons were written prior to the introduction of `std::string_view`, and still use `const std::string&` for function parameters when `std::string_view` should be preferred. We’re working on cleaning these up.

# Ownership issues

A `std::string_view`‘s lifetime is independent of that of the string it is viewing (meaning the string being viewed can be destroyed before the `std::string_view` object). If this happens, then accessing the `std::string_view` will cause undefined behavior.

The string that a `std::string_view` is viewing has to have been created somewhere else. It might be a string literal that lives as long as the program does, or a `std::string`, in which case the string lives until the `std::string` decides to destroy it or the `std::string` dies.

`std::string_view` can’t create any strings on its own, because it’s just a view.

Here’s an example of a program that has an ownership issue:

```cpp
#include <iostream>
#include <string>
#include <string_view>

std::string_view askForName()
{
  std::cout << "What's your name?\n";

  // Use a std::string, because std::cin needs to modify it.
  std::string name{};
  std::cin >> name;

  // We're switching to std::string_view for demonstrative purposes only.
  // If you already have a std::string, there's no reason to switch to
  // a std::string_view.
  std::string_view view{ name };

  std::cout << "Hello " << view << '\n';

  return view;
} // name dies, and so does the string that name created.

int main()
{
  std::string_view view{ askForName() };

  // view is observing a string that already died.
  std::cout << "Your name is " << view << '\n'; // Undefined behavior

  return 0;
}
```

COPY

```
What's your name?
nascardriver
Hello nascardriver
Your name is �P@�P@
```

In function `askForName()`, we create `name` and fill it with data from `std::cin`. Then we create `view`, which can view that string. At the end of the function, we return `view`, but the string it is viewing (`name`) is destroyed, so `view` is now pointing to deallocated memory. The function returns a dangling `std::string_view`.

Accessing the returned `std::string_view` in `main` causes undefined behavior, which on the author’s machine produced weird characters.

The same can happen when we create a `std::string_view` from a `std::string` and then modify the `std::string`. Modifying a `std::string` can cause its internal string to die and be replaced with a new one in a different place. The `std::string_view` will still look at where the old string was, but it’s not there anymore.

> **Warning**
>
> Make sure that the underlying string viewed with a `std::string_view` does not go out of scope and isn’t modified while using the std::string_view.

# Opening the window (kinda) via the data() function

The string being viewed by a `std::string_view` can be accessed by using the `data()` function, which returns a C-style string. This provides fast access to the string being viewed (as a C-string). But it should also only be used if the `std::string_view`‘s view hasn’t been modified (e.g. by `remove_prefix` or `remove_suffix`) and the string being viewed is null-terminated.

In the following example, `std::strlen` doesn’t know what a `std::string_view` is, so we need to pass it `str.data()`:

```cpp
#include <cstring> // For std::strlen
#include <iostream>
#include <string_view>

int main()
{
  std::string_view str{ "balloon" };

  std::cout << str << '\n';

  // We use std::strlen because it's simple, this could be any other function
  // that needs a null-terminated string.
  // It's okay to use data() because we haven't modified the view, and the
  // string is null-terminated.
  std::cout << std::strlen(str.data()) << '\n';

  return 0;
}
```

COPY

```
balloon
7
```

When a `std::string_view` has been modified, `data()` doesn’t always do what we’d like it to. The following example demonstrates what happens when we access `data()` after modifying the view:

```cpp
#include <cstring>
#include <iostream>
#include <string_view>

int main()
{
  std::string_view str{ "balloon" };

  // Remove the "b"
  str.remove_prefix(1);
  // remove the "oon"
  str.remove_suffix(3);
  // Remember that the above doesn't modify the string, it only changes
  // the region that str is observing.

  std::cout << str << " has " << std::strlen(str.data()) << " letter(s)\n";
  std::cout << "str.data() is " << str.data() << '\n';
  std::cout << "str is " << str << '\n';

  return 0;
}
```

COPY

```
all has 6 letter(s)
str.data() is alloon
str is all
```

Clearly this isn’t what we’d intended, and is a consequence of trying to access the data() of a `std::string_view` that has been modified. The length information about the string is lost when we access `data()`. `std::strlen` and `std::cout` keep reading characters from the underlying string until they find the null-terminator, which is at the end of “balloon”.

> **Warning**
>
> Only use `std::string_view::data()` if the `std::string_view`‘s view hasn’t been modified and the string being viewed is null-terminated. Using `std::string_view::data()` of a non-null-terminated string can cause undefined behavior.

# Incomplete implementation

Being a relatively recent feature, `std::string_view` isn’t implemented as well as it could be.

```cpp
std::string s{ "hello" };
std::string_view v{ "world" };

// Doesn't work
std::cout << (s + v) << '\n';
std::cout << (v + s) << '\n';

// Potentially unsafe, or not what we want, because we're treating
// the std::string_view as a C-style string.
std::cout << (s + v.data()) << '\n';
std::cout << (v.data() + s) << '\n';

// Ok, but ugly and wasteful because we have to construct a new std::string.
std::cout << (s + std::string{ v }) << '\n';
std::cout << (std::string{ v } + s) << '\n';
std::cout << (s + static_cast<std::string>(v)) << '\n';
std::cout << (static_cast<std::string>(v) + s) << '\n';
```

COPY

There’s no reason why line 5 and 6 shouldn’t work. They will probably be supported in a future C++ version.
