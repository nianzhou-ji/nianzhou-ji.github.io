
In C++, a **reference** is an alias for an existing object. Once a reference has been defined, any operation on the reference is applied to the object being referenced.

This means we can use a reference to read or modify the object being referenced. Although references might seem silly, useless, or redundant at first, references are used everywhere in C++ (we’ll see examples of this in a few lessons).

You can also create references to functions, though this is done less often.

Modern C++ contains two types of references: `lvalue references`, and `rvalue references`. In this chapter, we’ll discuss lvalue references.

> Because we’ll be talking about `lvalues` and `rvalues` in this lesson, please review [9.2 -- Value categories (lvalues and rvalues)](https://www.learncpp.com/cpp-tutorial/value-categories-lvalues-and-rvalues/) if you need a refresher on these terms before proceeding.

Rvalue references are covered in the chapter on `move semantics` ([chapter M](https://www.learncpp.com/#ChapterM)).

# Lvalue reference types

An **lvalue reference** (commonly just called a `reference` since prior to C++11 there was only one type of reference) acts as an alias for an existing lvalue (such as a variable).

To declare an lvalue reference type, we use an ampersand (&) in the type declaration:

```cpp
int      // a normal int type
int&     // an lvalue reference to an int object
double&  // an lvalue reference to a double object
```

COPY

# Lvalue reference variables

One of the things we can do with an lvalue reference type is create an lvalue reference variable. An **lvalue reference variable** is a variable that acts as a reference to an lvalue (usually another variable).

To create an lvalue reference variable, we simply define a variable with an lvalue reference type:

```cpp
#include <iostream>

int main()
{
    int x { 5 };    // x is a normal integer variable
    int& ref { x }; // ref is an lvalue reference variable that can now be used as an alias for variable x

    std::cout << x << '\n';  // print the value of x (5)
    std::cout << ref << '\n'; // print the value of x via ref (5)

    return 0;
}
```

COPY

In the above example, the type `int&` defines `ref` as an lvalue reference to an int, which we then initialize with lvalue expression `x`. Thereafter, `ref` and `x` can be used synonymously. This program thus prints:

```
5
5
```

From the compiler’s perspective, it doesn’t matter whether the ampersand is “attached” to the type name (`int& ref`) or the variable’s name (`int &ref`), and which you choose is a matter of style. Modern C++ programmers tend to prefer attaching the ampersand to the type, ==as it makes clearer that the reference is part of the type information, not the identifier.==

> **Best practice**
>
> When defining a reference, place the ampersand next to the type (not the reference variable’s name).

> **For advanced readers**
>
> For those of you already familiar with pointers, the ampersand in this context does not mean “address of”, it means “lvalue reference to”.

# Modifying values through an lvalue reference

In the above example, we showed that we can use a reference to read the value of the object being referenced. We can also use a reference to modify the value of the object being referenced:

```cpp
#include <iostream>

int main()
{
    int x { 5 }; // normal integer variable
    int& ref { x }; // ref is now an alias for variable x

    std::cout << x << ref << '\n'; // print 55

    x = 6; // x now has value 6

    std::cout << x << ref << '\n'; // prints 66

    ref = 7; // the object being referenced (x) now has value 7

    std::cout << x << ref << '\n'; // prints 77

    return 0;
}
```

COPY

This code prints:

```
55
66
77
```

In the above example, `ref` is an alias for `x`, so we are able to change the value of `x` through either `x` or `ref`.

# Initialization of lvalue references

Much like constants, all references must be initialized.

```cpp
int main()
{
    int& invalidRef;   // error: references must be initialized

    int x { 5 };
    int& ref { x }; // okay: reference to int is bound to int variable

    return 0;
}
```

COPY

When a reference is initialized with an object (or function), we say it is **bound** to that object (or function). The process by which such a reference is bound is called **reference binding**. The object (or function) being referenced is sometimes called the **referent**.

==Lvalue references must be bound to a *modifiable* lvalue.==

```cpp
int main()
{
    int x { 5 };
    int& ref { x }; // valid: lvalue reference bound to a modifiable lvalue

    const int y { 5 };
    int& invalidRef { y };  // invalid: can't bind to a non-modifiable lvalue
    int& invalidRef2 { 0 }; // invalid: can't bind to an r-value

    return 0;
}
```

COPY

Lvalue references can’t be bound to non-modifiable lvalues or rvalues (otherwise you’d be able to change those values through the reference, which would be a violation of their const-ness). For this reason, lvalue references are occasionally called **lvalue references to non-const** (sometimes shortened to **non-const reference**).

In most cases, the type of the reference must match the type of the referent (there are some exceptions to this rule that we’ll discuss when we get into inheritance):

```cpp
int main()
{
    int x { 5 };
    int& ref { x }; // okay: reference to int is bound to int variable

    double y { 6.0 };
    int& invalidRef { y }; // invalid; reference to int cannot bind to double variable
    double& invalidRef2 { x }; // invalid: reference to double cannot bind to int variable

    return 0;
}
```

COPY

Lvalue references to `void` are disallowed (what would be the point?).

# References can’t be reseated (changed to refer to another object)

Once initialized, a reference in C++ cannot be **reseated**, meaning it cannot be changed to reference another object.

New C++ programmers often try to reseat a reference by using assignment to provide the reference with another variable to reference. This will compile and run -- but not function as expected. Consider the following program:

```cpp
#include <iostream>

int main()
{
    int x { 5 };
    int y { 6 };

    int& ref { x }; // ref is now an alias for x

    ref = y; // assigns 6 (the value of y) to x (the object being referenced by ref)
    // The above line does NOT change ref into a reference to variable y!

    std::cout << x << '\n'; // user is expecting this to print 5

    return 0;
}
```

COPY

Perhaps surprisingly, this prints:

```
6
```

When a reference is evaluated in an expression, it resolves to the object it’s referencing. So `ref = y` doesn’t change `ref` to now reference `y`. Rather, because `ref` is an alias for `x`, the expression evaluates as if it was written `x = y` -- and since `y` evaluates to value `6`, `x` is assigned the value `6`.

# Lvalue reference scope and duration

Reference variables follow the same scoping and duration rules that normal variables do:

```cpp
#include <iostream>

int main()
{
    int x { 5 }; // normal integer
    int& ref { x }; // reference to variable value

     return 0;
} // x and ref die here
```

COPY

# References and referents have independent lifetimes

With one exception (that we’ll cover next lesson), the lifetime of a reference and the lifetime of its referent are independent. In other words, both of the following are true:

- A reference can be destroyed before the object it is referencing.
- The object being referenced can be destroyed before the reference.

When a reference is destroyed before the referent, the referent is not impacted. The following program demonstrates this:

```cpp
#include <iostream>

int main()
{
    int x { 5 };

    {
        int& ref { x };   // ref is a reference to x
        std::cout << ref << '\n'; // prints value of ref (5)
    } // ref is destroyed here -- x is unaware of this

    std::cout << x << '\n'; // prints value of x (5)

    return 0;
} // x destroyed here
```

COPY

The above prints:

```
5
5
```

When `ref` dies, variable `x` carries on as normal, blissfully unaware that a reference to it has been destroyed.

# Dangling references

When an object being referenced is destroyed before a reference to it, the reference is left referencing an object that no longer exists. Such a reference is called a **dangling reference**. Accessing a dangling reference leads to undefined behavior.

Dangling references are fairly easy to avoid, but we’ll show a case where this can happen in practice in lesson [9.11 -- Return by reference and return by address](https://www.learncpp.com/cpp-tutorial/return-by-reference-and-return-by-address/).

# References aren’t objects

==Perhaps surprisingly, references are not objects in C++.== A reference is not required to exist or occupy storage. If possible, the compiler will optimize references away by replacing all occurrences of a reference with the referent. However, this isn’t always possible, and in such cases, references may require storage.

This also means that the term “reference variable” is a bit of a misnomer, as variables are objects with a name, and references aren’t objects.

Because references aren’t objects, they can’t be used anywhere an object is required (e.g. you can’t have a reference to a reference, since an lvalue reference must reference an identifiable object). In cases where you need a reference that is an object or a reference that can be reseated, `std::reference_wrapper` (which we cover in lesson [16.3 -- Aggregation](https://www.learncpp.com/cpp-tutorial/aggregation/)) provides a solution.

As an aside…

Consider the following variables:

```cpp
int var{};
int& ref1{ var };  // an lvalue reference bound to var
int& ref2{ ref1 }; // an lvalue reference bound to var
```

COPY

Because `ref2` (a reference) is initialized with `ref1` (a reference), you might be tempted to conclude that `ref2` is a reference to a reference. It is not. Because `ref1` is a reference to `var`, when used in an expression (such as an initializer), `ref1` evaluates to `var`. So `ref2` is just a normal lvalue reference (as indicated by its type `int&`), bound to `var`.

A reference to a reference (to an `int`) would have syntax `int&&` -- but since C++ doesn’t support references to references, this syntax was repurposed in C++11 to indicate an rvalue reference (which we cover in lesson [M.2 -- R-value references](https://www.learncpp.com/cpp-tutorial/rvalue-references/)).

Question #1

Determine what values the following program prints by yourself (do not compile the program).

```cpp
#include <iostream>

int main()
{
    int x{ 1 };
    int& ref{ x };

    std::cout << x << ref << '\n';

    int y{ 2 };
    ref = y;
    y = 3;

    std::cout << x << ref << '\n';

    x = 4;

    std::cout << x << ref << '\n';

    return 0;
}
