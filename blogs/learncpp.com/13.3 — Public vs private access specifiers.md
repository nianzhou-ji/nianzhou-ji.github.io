# Public and private members

Consider the following struct:

```cpp
struct DateStruct // members are public by default
{
    int month {}; // public by default, can be accessed by anyone
    int day {}; // public by default, can be accessed by anyone
    int year {}; // public by default, can be accessed by anyone
};

int main()
{
    DateStruct date;
    date.month = 10;
    date.day = 14;
    date.year= 2020;

    return 0;
}
```

COPY

In the main() function of the example above, we declare a DateStruct and then we directly access its members in order to assign values to them. This works because all members of a struct are public members by default. **Public members** are members of a struct or class that can be accessed directly by anyone, including from code that exists outside the struct or class. In this case, function main() exists outside of the struct, but it can directly access members month, day, and year, because they are public members.

The code outside of a struct or class is sometimes called **the public**: the public is only allowed to access the public members of a struct or class, which makes sense.

Now consider the following almost-identical class:

```cpp
class DateClass // members are private by default
{
    int m_month {}; // private by default, can only be accessed by other members
    int m_day {}; // private by default, can only be accessed by other members
    int m_year {}; // private by default, can only be accessed by other members
};

int main()
{
    DateClass date;
    date.m_month = 10; // error
    date.m_day = 14; // error
    date.m_year = 2020; // error

    return 0;
}
```

COPY

If you were to compile this program, you would receive errors. This is because by default, all members of a class are private. **Private members** are members of a class that can only be accessed by other members of the class (not by the public). Because main() is not a member of DateClass, it does not have access to date’s private members.

# Access specifiers

Although class members are private by default, we can make them public by using the public keyword:

```cpp
class DateClass
{
public: // note use of public keyword here, and the colon
    int m_month {}; // public, can be accessed by anyone
    int m_day {}; // public, can be accessed by anyone
    int m_year {}; // public, can be accessed by anyone
};

int main()
{
    DateClass date;
    date.m_month = 10; // okay because m_month is public
    date.m_day = 14;  // okay because m_day is public
    date.m_year = 2020;  // okay because m_year is public

    return 0;
}
```

COPY

Because DateClass’s members are now public, they can be accessed directly by main().

The public keyword, along with the following colon, is called an access specifier. **Access specifiers** determine who has access to the members that follow the specifier. Each of the members “acquires” the access level of the previous access specifier (or, if none is provided, the default access specifier).

C++ provides 3 different access specifier keywords: public, private, and protected. Public and private are used to make the members that follow them public members or private members respectively. The third access specifier, protected, works much like private does. We will discuss the difference between the private and protected access specifier when we cover inheritance.

# Mixing access specifiers

A class can (and almost always does) use multiple access specifiers to set the access levels of each of its members. There is no limit to the number of access specifiers you can use in a class.

==In general, member variables are usually made private, and member functions are usually made public. We’ll take a closer look at why in the next lesson.==

> ==**Best practice**==
>
> ==Make member variables private, and member functions public, unless you have a good reason not to.==

Let’s take a look at an example of a class that uses both private and public access:

```cpp
#include <iostream>

class DateClass // members are private by default
{
    int m_month {}; // private by default, can only be accessed by other members
    int m_day {}; // private by default, can only be accessed by other members
    int m_year {}; // private by default, can only be accessed by other members

public:
    void setDate(int month, int day, int year) // public, can be accessed by anyone
    {
        // setDate() can access the private members of the class because it is a member of the class itself
        m_month = month;
        m_day = day;
        m_year = year;
    }

    void print() // public, can be accessed by anyone
    {
        std::cout << m_month << '/' << m_day << '/' << m_year;
    }
};

int main()
{
    DateClass date;
    date.setDate(10, 14, 2020); // okay, because setDate() is public
    date.print(); // okay, because print() is public
    std::cout << '\n';

    return 0;
}
```

COPY

This program prints:

```
10/14/2020
```

Note that although we can’t access date’s members variables m_month, m_day, and m_year directly from main (because they are private), we are able to access them indirectly through public member functions setDate() and print()!

The group of public members of a class are often referred to as a **public interface**. Because only public members can be accessed from outside of the class, the public interface defines how programs using the class will interact with the class. Note that main() is restricted to setting the date and printing the date. The class protects the member variables from being accessed or edited directly.

Some programmers prefer to list private members first, because the public members typically use the private ones, so it makes sense to define the private ones first. However, a good counterargument is that users of the class don’t care about the private members, so the public ones should come first. Either way is fine.

# Access controls work on a per-class basis

Consider the following program:

```cpp
#include <iostream>

class DateClass // members are private by default
{
	int m_month {}; // private by default, can only be accessed by other members
	int m_day {}; // private by default, can only be accessed by other members
	int m_year {}; // private by default, can only be accessed by other members

public:
	void setDate(int month, int day, int year)
	{
		m_month = month;
		m_day = day;
		m_year = year;
	}

	void print()
	{
		std::cout << m_month << '/' << m_day << '/' << m_year;
	}

	// Note the addition of this function
	void copyFrom(const DateClass& d)
	{
		// Note that we can access the private members of d directly
		m_month = d.m_month;
		m_day = d.m_day;
		m_year = d.m_year;
	}
};

int main()
{
	DateClass date;
	date.setDate(10, 14, 2020); // okay, because setDate() is public

	DateClass copy {};
	copy.copyFrom(date); // okay, because copyFrom() is public
	copy.print();
	std::cout << '\n';

	return 0;
}
```

COPY

One nuance of C++ that is often missed or misunderstood is that access control works on a per-class basis, not a per-object basis. This means that when a function has access to the private members of a class, it can access the private members of *any* object of that class type that it can see.

In the above example, copyFrom() is a member of DateClass, which gives it access to the private members of DateClass. This means copyFrom() can not only directly access the private members of the implicit object it is operating on (copy), it also means it has direct access to the private members of DateClass parameter d! If parameter d were some other type, this would not be the case.

This can be particularly useful when we need to copy members from one object of a class to another object of the same class. We’ll also see this topic show up again when we talk about overloading operator<< to print members of a class in the next chapter.

# Structs vs classes revisited

Now that we’ve talked about access specifiers, we can talk about the actual differences between a class and a struct in C++. A class defaults its members to private. A struct defaults its members to public.

That’s it!

(Okay, to be pedantic, there’s one more minor difference -- structs inherit from other classes publicly and classes inherit privately. We’ll cover what this means in a future chapter, but this particular point is practically irrelevant since you should never rely on the defaults anyway).
