# Constructors with overlapping functionality

When you instantiate a new object, the object’s constructor is called implicitly. It’s not uncommon to have a class with multiple constructors that have overlapping functionality. Consider the following class:

```cpp
class Foo
{
public:
    Foo()
    {
        // code to do A
    }

    Foo(int value)
    {
        // code to do A
        // code to do B
    }
};
```

COPY

This class has two constructors: a default constructor, and a constructor that takes an integer. Because the “code to do A” portion of the constructor is required by both constructors, the code is duplicated in each constructor.

As you’ve (hopefully) learned by now, having duplicate code is something to be avoided as much as possible, so let’s take a look at some ways to address this.

The obvious solution doesn’t work

The obvious solution would be to have the Foo(int) constructor call the Foo() constructor to do the A portion.



```cpp
class Foo
{
public:
    Foo()
    {
        // code to do A
    }

    Foo(int value)
    {
        Foo(); // use the above constructor to do A (doesn't work)
        // code to do B
    }
};
```

COPY

However, if you try to have one constructor call another constructor in this way, it will compile and maybe cause a warning, but it will not work as you expect, and you will likely spend a long time trying to figure out why, even with a debugger. What’s happening is that `Foo();` instantiates a new `Foo` object, which is immediately discarded, because it’s not stored in a variable.

# Delegating constructors

Constructors are allowed to call other constructors from the same class. This process is called **delegating constructors** (or **constructor chaining**).

To have one constructor call another, simply call the constructor in the member initializer list. This is one case where calling another constructor directly is acceptable. Applied to our example above:

```cpp
class Foo
{
private:

public:
    Foo()
    {
        // code to do A
    }

    Foo(int value): Foo{} // use Foo() default constructor to do A
    {
        // code to do B
    }

};
```

COPY

This works exactly as you’d expect. Make sure you’re calling the constructor from the member initializer list, not in the body of the constructor.

Here’s another example of using delegating constructors to reduce redundant code:

```cpp
#include <iostream>
#include <string>
#include <string_view>

class Employee
{
private:
    int m_id{};
    std::string m_name{};

public:
    Employee(int id=0, std::string_view name=""):
        m_id{ id }, m_name{ name }
    {
        std::cout << "Employee " << m_name << " created.\n";
    }

    // Use a delegating constructor to minimize redundant code
    Employee(std::string_view name) : Employee{ 0, name }
    { }
};
```

COPY

This class has 2 constructors, one of which delegates to Employee(int, std::string_view). In this way, the amount of redundant code is minimized (we only have to write one constructor body instead of two).

A few additional notes about delegating constructors. First, a constructor that delegates to another constructor is not allowed to do any member initialization itself. So your constructors can delegate or initialize, but not both.

Second, it’s possible for one constructor to delegate to another constructor, which delegates back to the first constructor. This forms an infinite loop, and will cause your program to run out of stack space and crash. You can avoid this by ensuring all of your constructors resolve to a non-delegating constructor.

# Using a normal member function for setup

Because a constructor can only initialize or delegate, this leads to a challenge if our default constructor does some common initialization. Consider the following class:



```cpp
class Foo
{
private:
    const int m_value { 0 };

public:
    Foo()
    {
         // code to do some common setup tasks (e.g. open a file or database)
    }

    Foo(int value) : m_value { value } // we must initialize m_value since it's const
    {
        // how do we get to the common initialization code in Foo()?
    }

};
```

COPY

Our `Foo(int)` constructor can either initialize `m_value`, or delegate to `Foo()` to access the setup code, but not both. But what if we need to do both? A bad solution would be to copy the setup code from our default constructor to each of our other constructors. But this will result in duplicate code, and a potential maintenance headache.

Constructors are allowed to call non-constructor member functions (and non-member functions), so a better solution is to use a normal (non-constructor) member function to handle the common setup tasks, like this:

```cpp
#include <iostream>

class Foo
{
private:
    const int m_value { 0 };

    void setup() // setup is private so it can only be used by our constructors
    {
        // code to do some common setup tasks (e.g. open a file or database)
        std::cout << "Setting things up...\n";
    }

public:
    Foo()
    {
        setup();
    }

    Foo(int value) : m_value { value } // we must initialize m_value since it's const
    {
        setup();
    }

};

int main()
{
    Foo a;
    Foo b{ 5 };

    return 0;
}
```

COPY

In this case, we’ve created a `setup()` member function to handle various setup tasks that we need, and both of our constructors call `setup()`. We’ve made this function private so we can ensure that only members of our class can call it.

Of course, `setup()` isn’t a constructor, so it can’t initialize members. By the time the constructor calls `setup()`, the members have already been created (and initialized if an initialization value was provided). The `setup()` function can only assign values to members or do other types of setup tasks that can be done through normal statements (e.g. open files or databases). The `setup()` function can’t do things like bind a member reference or set a const value (both of which must be done on initialization), or assign values to members that don’t support assignment.

# Resetting a class object

Relatedly, you may find yourself in the situation where you want to write a member function (e.g. named `reset()`) to reset a class object back to the default state.

Because you probably already have a default constructor that initializes your members to the appropriate default values, you may be tempted to try to call the default constructor directly from `reset()`. However, trying to call a constructor directly will generally result in unexpected behavior as we have shown above, so that won’t work.

A mediocre implementation of a `reset()` function might look like this:

```cpp
#include <iostream>

class Foo
{
private:
    int m_a{ 1 };
    int m_b{ 2 };

public:
    Foo()
    {
    }

    Foo(int a, int b)
        : m_a{ a }, m_b{ b }
    {
    }

    void print()
    {
        std::cout << m_a << ' ' << m_b << '\n';
    }

    void reset()
    {
        m_a = 1;
        m_b = 2;
    }
};

int main()
{
    Foo a{ 3, 4 };
    a.reset();

    a.print();

    return 0;
}
```

COPY

While this works, it violates the DRY principle, as we have our “default” values in two places: once in the non-static member initializers, and again in the body of `reset()`. There is no way for the `reset()` function to get the default values from the non-static initializer.

==However, if the class is assignable (meaning it has an accessible assignment operator), we can create a new class object, and then use assignment to overwrite the values in the object we want to reset:==

```cpp
#include <iostream>

class Foo
{
private:
    int m_a{ 5 };
    int m_b{ 6 };


public:
    Foo()
    {
    }

    Foo(int a, int b)
        : m_a{ a }, m_b{ b }
    {
    }

    void print()
    {
        std::cout << m_a << ' ' << m_b << '\n';
    }

    void reset()
    {
        // consider this a bit of magic for now
        *this = Foo(); // create new Foo object, then use assignment to overwrite our implicit object
    }
};

int main()
{
    Foo a{ 1, 2 };
    a.reset();

    a.print();

    return 0;
}
```

COPY

In the above `reset()` function, we first create a default `Foo` object (which will have default values). Then we assign that default `Foo` object to the object that member function `reset()` was called on (`*this`). The compiler will do a memberwise copy.
