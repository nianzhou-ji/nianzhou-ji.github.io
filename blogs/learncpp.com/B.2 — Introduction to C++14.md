**What is C++14?**

On August 18, 2014, the [ISO (International Organization for Standardization)](https://www.iso.org/home.html) approved a new version of C++, called C++14. Unlike C++11, which added a huge amount of new functionality, C++14 is a comparatively minor update, mainly featuring bug fixes and small improvements.
