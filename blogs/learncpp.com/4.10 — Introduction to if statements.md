Consider a case where you’re going to go to the market, and your roommate tells you, “if they have strawberries on sale, buy some”. This is a conditional statement, meaning that you’ll execute some action (“buy some”) only if the condition (“they have strawberries on sale”) is true.

Such conditions are common in programming, as they allow us to implement conditional behavior into our programs. The simplest kind of conditional statement in C++ is called an *if statement*. An **if statement** allows us to execute one (or more) lines of code only if some condition is true.

The simplest *if statement* takes the following form:

```
if (condition) true_statement;
```

For readability, this is more often written as following:

```
if (condition)
    true_statement;
```

A **condition** (also called a **conditional expression**) is an expression that evaluates to a Boolean value.



If the *condition* of an *if statement* evaluates to Boolean value *true*, then *true_statement* is executed. If the *condition* instead evaluates to Boolean value *false*, then *true_statement* is skipped.

# A sample program using an if statement

Given the following program:

```cpp
#include <iostream>

int main()
{
    std::cout << "Enter an integer: ";
    int x {};
    std::cin >> x;

    if (x == 0)
        std::cout << "The value is zero\n";

    return 0;
}
```

COPY

Here’s output from one run of this program:

```
Enter an integer: 0
The value is zero
```

Let’s examine how this works in more detail.

First, the user enters an integer. Then the condition *x == 0* is evaluated. The *equality operator* (==) is used to test whether two values are equal. Operator== returns *true* if the operands are equal, and *false* if they are not. Since *x* has value 0, and *0 == 0* is true, this expression evaluates to *true*.

Because the condition has evaluated to *true*, the subsequent statement executes, printing *The value is zero*.

Here’s another run of this program:

```
Enter an integer: 5
```

In this case, *x == 0* evaluates to *false*. The subsequent statement is skipped, the program ends, and nothing else is printed.

> **Warning**
>
> *If statements* only conditionally execute a single statement. We talk about how to conditionally execute multiple statements in lesson [7.2 -- If statements and blocks](https://www.learncpp.com/cpp-tutorial/if-statements-and-blocks/).

# If-else

Given the above example, what if we wanted to tell the user that the number they entered was non-zero?



We could write something like this:

```cpp
#include <iostream>

int main()
{
    std::cout << "Enter an integer: ";
    int x {};
    std::cin >> x;

    if (x == 0)
        std::cout << "The value is zero\n";
    if (x != 0)
        std::cout << "The value is non-zero\n";

    return 0;
}
```

COPY

Or this:

```cpp
#include <iostream>

int main()
{
    std::cout << "Enter an integer: ";
    int x {};
    std::cin >> x;

    bool zero { (x == 0) };
    if (zero)
        std::cout << "The value is zero\n";
    if (!zero)
        std::cout << "The value is non-zero\n";

    return 0;
}
```

COPY

Both of these programs are more complex than they need to be. Instead, we can use an alternative form of the *if statement* called *if-else*. *If-else* takes the following form:

```
if (condition)
    true_statement;
else
    false_statement;
```

If the *condition* evaluates to Boolean true, *true_statement* executes. Otherwise *false_statement* executes.

Let’s amend our previous program to use an *if-else*.

```cpp
#include <iostream>

int main()
{
    std::cout << "Enter an integer: ";
    int x {};
    std::cin >> x;

    if (x == 0)
        std::cout << "The value is zero\n";
    else
        std::cout << "The value is non-zero\n";

    return 0;
}
```

COPY

Now our program will produce the following output:

```
Enter an integer: 0
The value is zero
Enter an integer: 5
The value is non-zero
```

Chaining if statements

Sometimes we want to check if several things are true or false in sequence. We can do so by chaining an *if statement* to a prior *if-else*, like so:

```cpp
#include <iostream>

int main()
{
    std::cout << "Enter an integer: ";
    int x {};
    std::cin >> x;

    if (x > 0)
        std::cout << "The value is positive\n";
    else if (x < 0)
        std::cout << "The value is negative\n";
    else
        std::cout << "The value is zero\n";

    return 0;
}
```

COPY

The *less than operator* (<) is used to test whether one value is less than another. Similarly, the *greater than operator* (>) is used to test whether one value is greater than another. These operators both return Boolean values.

Here’s output from a few runs of this program:



```
Enter an integer: 4
The value is positive
Enter an integer: -3
The value is negative
Enter an integer: 0
The value is zero
```

Note that you can chain *if statements* as many times as you have conditions you want to evaluate. We’ll see an example in the quiz where this is useful.

Boolean return values and if statements

In the previous lesson ([4.9 -- Boolean values](https://www.learncpp.com/cpp-tutorial/boolean-values/)), we wrote this program using a function that returns a Boolean value:

```cpp
#include <iostream>

// returns true if x and y are equal, false otherwise
bool isEqual(int x, int y)
{
    return (x == y); // operator== returns true if x equals y, and false otherwise
}

int main()
{
    std::cout << "Enter an integer: ";
    int x {};
    std::cin >> x;

    std::cout << "Enter another integer: ";
    int y {};
    std::cin >> y;

    std::cout << std::boolalpha; // print bools as true or false

    std::cout << x << " and " << y << " are equal? ";
    std::cout << isEqual(x, y); // will return true or false

    return 0;
}
```

COPY

Let’s improve this program using an *if statement*:

```cpp
#include <iostream>

// returns true if x and y are equal, false otherwise
bool isEqual(int x, int y)
{
    return (x == y); // operator== returns true if x equals y, and false otherwise
}

int main()
{
    std::cout << "Enter an integer: ";
    int x {};
    std::cin >> x;

    std::cout << "Enter another integer: ";
    int y {};
    std::cin >> y;

    if (isEqual(x, y))
        std::cout << x << " and " << y << " are equal\n";
    else
        std::cout << x << " and " << y << " are not equal\n";

    return 0;
}
```

COPY

Two runs of this program:



```
Enter an integer: 5
Enter another integer: 5
5 and 5 are equal
Enter an integer: 6
Enter another integer: 4
6 and 4 are not equal
```

In this case, our conditional expression is simply a function call to function *isEqual*, which returns a Boolean value.

Non-Boolean conditionals

In all of the examples above, our conditionals have been either Boolean values (true or false), Boolean variables, or functions that return a Boolean value. What happens if your conditional is an expression that does not evaluate to a Boolean value?

In such a case, the conditional expression is converted to a Boolean value: non-zero values get converted to Boolean *true*, and zero-values get converted to Boolean *false*.

Therefore, if we do something like this:

```cpp
#include <iostream>

int main()
{
    if (4) // nonsensical, but for the sake of example...
        std::cout << "hi";
    else
        std::cout << "bye";

    return 0;
}
```

COPY

This will print “hi”, since 4 is a non-zero value that gets converted to Boolean *true*, causing the statement attached to the *if* to execute.



We’ll continue our exploration of *if statements* in future lesson [7.2 -- If statements and blocks](https://www.learncpp.com/cpp-tutorial/if-statements-and-blocks/).
