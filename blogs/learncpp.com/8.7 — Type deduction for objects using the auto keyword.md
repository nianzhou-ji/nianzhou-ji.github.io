There’s a subtle redundancy lurking in this simple variable definition:

```cpp
double d{ 5.0 };
```

COPY

Because C++ is a strongly-typed language, we are required to provide an explicit type for all objects. Thus, we’ve specified that variable `d` is of type double.

However, the literal value `5.0` used to initialize `d` also has type double (implicitly determined via the format of the literal).

In cases where we want a variable and its initializer to have the same type, we’re effectively providing the same type information twice.

# Type deduction for initialized variables

**Type deduction** (also sometimes called **type inference**) is a feature that allows the compiler to deduce the type of an object from the object’s initializer. To use type deduction, the `auto` keyword is used in place of the variable’s type:

```cpp
int main()
{
    auto d{ 5.0 }; // 5.0 is a double literal, so d will be type double
    auto i{ 1 + 2 }; // 1 + 2 evaluates to an int, so i will be type int
    auto x { i }; // i is an int, so x will be type int too

    return 0;
}
```

COPY

In the first case, because `5.0` is a double literal, the compiler will deduce that variable `d` should be of type `double`. In the second case, the expression `1 + 2` yields an int result, so variable `i` will be of type `int`. In the third case, `i` was previously deduced to be of type `int`, so `x` will also be deduced to be of type `int`.

Because function calls are valid expressions, we can even use type deduction when our initializer is a function call:

```cpp
int add(int x, int y)
{
    return x + y;
}

int main()
{
    auto sum { add(5, 6) }; // add() returns an int, so sum's type will be deduced to int
    return 0;
}
```

COPY

The `add()` function returns an int value, so the compiler will deduce that variable `sum` should have type `int`.

Type deduction will not work for objects that do not have initializers or empty initializers. Thus, the following is not valid:

```cpp
int main()
{
    auto x; // The compiler is unable to deduce the type of x
    auto y{ }; // The compiler is unable to deduce the type of y

    return 0;
}
```

COPY

Although using type deduction for fundamental data types only saves a few (if any) keystrokes, in future lessons we will see examples where the types get complex and lengthy (and in some cases, can be hard to figure out). In those cases, using `auto` can save a lot of typing (and typos).

# Type deduction drops const qualifiers

In most cases, type deduction will drop the `const` qualifier from deduced types. For example:

```cpp
int main()
{
    const int x { 5 }; // x has type const int
    auto y { x };      // y will be type int (const is dropped)
}
```

COPY

In the above example, `x` has type `const int`, but when deducing a type for variable `y` using `x` as the initializer, type deduction deduces the type as `int`, not `const int`.

If you want a deduced type to be const, you must supply the const yourself. To do so, simply use the `const` keyword in conjunction with the `auto` keyword:

```cpp
int main()
{
    const int x { 5 };  // x has type const int
    auto y { x };       // y will be type int (const is dropped)

    const auto z { x }; // z will be type const int (const is reapplied)
}
```

COPY

In this example, the type deduced from `x` will be `int` (the `const` is dropped), but because we’ve re-added a `const` qualifier during the definition of variable `z`, variable `z` will be a `const int`.

# Type deduction for string literals

For historical reasons, string literals in C++ have a strange type. Therefore, the following probably won’t work as expected:

```cpp
auto s { "Hello, world" }; // s will be type const char*, not std::string
```

COPY

If you want the type deduced from a string literal to be `std::string` or `std::string_view`, you’ll need to use the `s` or `sv` literal suffixes (covered in lesson [4.15 -- Literals](https://www.learncpp.com/cpp-tutorial/literals/)):

```cpp
#include <string>
#include <string_view>

int main()
{
    using namespace std::literals; // easiest way to access the s and sv suffixes

    auto s1 { "goo"s };  // "goo"s is a std::string literal, so s1 will be deduced as a std::string
    auto s2 { "moo"sv }; // "moo"sv is a std::string_view literal, so s2 will be deduced as a std::string_view

    return 0;
}
```

COPY

Type deduction benefits and downsides

Type deduction is not only convenient, but also has a number of other benefits.

First, if two or more variables are defined on sequential lines, the names of the variables will be lined up, helping to increase readability:

```cpp
// harder to read
int a { 5 };
double b { 6.7 };

// easier to read
auto c { 5 };
auto d { 6.7 };
```

COPY

Second, type deduction only works on variables that have initializers, so if you are in the habit of using type deduction, it can help avoid unintentionally uninitialized variables:

```cpp
int x; // oops, we forgot to initialize x, but the compiler may not complain
auto y; // the compiler will error out because it can't deduce a type for y
```

COPY

Third, you are guaranteed that there will be no unintended performance-impacting conversions:

```cpp
double x { 5 }; // bad: implicitly converts 5 from an int to a double
auto y { 5 }; // good: y is an int (hopefully that's what you wanted) and no conversion takes place
```

COPY

Type deduction also has a few downsides.

First, type deduction obscures an object’s type information in the code. Although a good IDE should be able to show you the deduced type (e.g. when hovering a variable), it’s still a bit easier to make type-based mistakes when using type deduction.

For example:

```cpp
auto y { 5 }; // oops, we wanted a double here but we accidentally provided an int literal
```

COPY

In the above code, if we’d explicitly specified `y` as type double, `y` would have been a double even though we accidentally provided an int literal initializer. With type deduction, `y` will be deduced to be of type int.

Here’s another example:

```cpp
#include <iostream>

int main()
{
     auto x { 3 };
     auto y { 2 };

     std::cout << x / y << '\n'; // oops, we wanted floating point division here

     return 0;
}
```

COPY

In this example, it’s less clear that we’re getting an integer division rather than a floating-point division.

Second, if the type of an initializer changes, the type of a variable using type deduction will also change, perhaps unexpectedly. Consider:

```cpp
auto sum { add(5, 6) + gravity };
```

COPY

If the return type of `add` changes from int to double, or `gravity` changes from int to double, `sum` will also change types from int to double.

Overall, the modern consensus is that type deduction is generally safe to use for objects, and that doing so can help make your code more readable by de-emphasizing type information so the logic of your code stands out better.
