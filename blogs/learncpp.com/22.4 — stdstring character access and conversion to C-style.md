**Character access**

There are two almost identical ways to access characters in a string. The easier to use and faster version is the overloaded operator[]:



**char& string::operator[] (size_type nIndex)** **const char& string::operator[] (size_type nIndex) const**Both of these functions return the character with index nIndexPassing an invalid index results in undefined behaviorBecause char& is the return type, you can use this to edit characters in the arraySample code:`std::string sSource{ "abcdefg" }; std::cout << sSource[5] << '\n'; sSource[5] = 'X'; std::cout << sSource << '\n';`COPYOutput:`f abcdeXg `

There is also a non-operator version. This version is slower since it uses exceptions to check if the nIndex is valid. If you are not sure whether nIndex is valid, you should use this version to access the array:



**char& string::at (size_type nIndex)** **const char& string::at (size_type nIndex) const**Both of these functions return the character with index nIndexPassing an invalid index results in an out_of_range exceptionBecause char& is the return type, you can use this to edit characters in the arraySample code:`std::string sSource{ "abcdefg" }; std::cout << sSource.at(5) << '\n'; sSource.at(5) = 'X'; std::cout << sSource << '\n';`COPYOutput:`f abcdeXg `

**Conversion to C-style arrays**

Many functions (including all C functions) expect strings to be formatted as C-style strings rather than std::string. For this reason, std::string provides 3 different ways to convert std::string to C-style strings.



**const char\* string::c_str () const**Returns the contents of the string as a const C-style stringA null terminator is appendedThe C-style string is owned by the std::string and should not be deletedSample code:`#include <cstring> std::string sSource{ "abcdefg" }; std::cout << std::strlen(sSource.c_str());`COPYOutput:`7 `



**const char\* string::data () const**Returns the contents of the string as a const C-style stringA null terminator is appended. This function performs the same action as `c_str()`The C-style string is owned by the std::string and should not be deletedSample code:`#include <cstring> std::string sSource{ "abcdefg" }; const char* szString{ "abcdefg" }; // memcmp compares the first n characters of two C-style strings and returns 0 if they are equal if (std::memcmp(sSource.data(), szString, sSource.length()) == 0)    std::cout << "The strings are equal"; else    std::cout << "The strings are not equal";`COPYOutput:`The strings are equal `



**size_type string::copy(char\* szBuf, size_type nLength, size_type nIndex = 0) const**Both flavors copy at most nLength characters of the string to szBuf, beginning with character nIndexThe number of characters copied is returnedNo null is appended. It is up to the caller to ensure szBuf is initialized to NULL or terminate the string using the returned lengthThe caller is responsible for not overflowing szBufSample code:`std::string sSource{ "sphinx of black quartz, judge my vow" }; char szBuf[20]; int nLength{ static_cast<int>(sSource.copy(szBuf, 5, 10)) }; szBuf[nLength] = '\0';  // Make sure we terminate the string in the buffer std::cout << szBuf << '\n';`COPYOutput:`black `

This function should be avoided where possible as it is relatively dangerous (as it is up to the caller to provide null-termination and avoid buffer overflows).
