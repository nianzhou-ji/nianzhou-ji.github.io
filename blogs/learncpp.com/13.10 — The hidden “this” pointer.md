One of the questions about classes that new object-oriented programmers often ask is, “When a member function is called, how does C++ keep track of which object it was called on?”. The answer is that C++ utilizes a hidden pointer named “this”! Let’s take a look at “this” in more detail.

The following is a simple class that holds an integer and provides a constructor and access functions. Note that no destructor is needed because C++ can clean up integer member variables for us.

```cpp
class Simple
{
private:
    int m_id;

public:
    Simple(int id)
        : m_id{ id }
    {
    }

    void setID(int id) { m_id = id; }
    int getID() { return m_id; }
};
```

COPY

Here’s a sample program that uses this class:

```cpp
#include <iostream>

int main()
{
    Simple simple{1};
    simple.setID(2);
    std::cout << simple.getID() << '\n';

    return 0;
}
```

COPY

As you would expect, this program produces the result:

```
2
```

Somehow, when we call `simple.setID(2);`, C++ knows that function setID() should operate on object simple, and that m_id actually refers to simple.m_id. Let’s examine the mechanics behind how this works.

# The hidden *this pointer

Take a look at the following line of code from the example above:

```cpp
simple.setID(2);
```

COPY

==Although the call to function setID() looks like it only has one argument, it actually has two! When compiled, the compiler converts `simple.setID(2);` into the following:==

```cpp
setID(&simple, 2); // note that simple has been changed from an object prefix to a function argument!
```

COPY

Note that this is now just a standard function call, and the object simple (which was formerly an object prefix) is now passed by address as an argument to the function.

But that’s only half of the answer. Since the function call now has an added argument, the member function definition needs to be modified to accept (and use) this argument as a parameter. Consequently, the following member function:

```cpp
void setID(int id) { m_id = id; }
```

COPY

is converted by the compiler into:

```cpp
void setID(Simple* const this, int id) { this->m_id = id; }
```

COPY

When the compiler compiles a normal member function, it implicitly adds a new parameter to the function named “this”. The **this pointer** is a hidden const pointer that holds the address of the object the member function was called on.

There’s just one more detail to take care of. Inside the member function, any class members (functions and variables) also need to be updated so they refer to the object the member function was called on. This is easily done by adding a “this->” prefix to each of them. Thus, in the body of function setID(), `m_id` (which is a class member variable) has been converted to `this->m_id`. Thus, when “this” points to the address of simple, this->m_id will resolve to simple.m_id.

Putting it all together:

1. When we call `simple.setID(2)`, the compiler actually calls setID(&simple, 2).
2. Inside setID(), the “this” pointer holds the address of object simple.
3. Any member variables inside setID() are prefixed with “this->”. So when we say `m_id = id`, the compiler is actually executing `this->m_id = id`, which in this case updates simple.m_id to id.

The good news is that all of this happens automatically, and it doesn’t really matter whether you remember how it works or not. All you need to remember is that all normal member functions have a “this” pointer that refers to the object the function was called on.

# “this” always points to the object being operated on

New programmers are sometimes confused about how many “this” pointers exist. Each member function has a “this” pointer parameter that is set to the address of the object being operated on. Consider:

```cpp
int main()
{
    Simple A{1}; // this = &A inside the Simple constructor
    Simple B{2}; // this = &B inside the Simple constructor
    A.setID(3); // this = &A inside member function setID
    B.setID(4); // this = &B inside member function setID

    return 0;
}
```

COPY

Note that the “this” pointer alternately holds the address of object A or B depending on whether we’ve called a member function on object A or B.

Because “this” is just a function parameter, it doesn’t add any memory usage to your class (just to the member function call, since that parameter needs to be passed to the function and stored in memory).

# Explicitly referencing “this”

Most of the time, you never need to explicitly reference the “this” pointer. However, there are a few occasions where doing so can be useful:

First, if you have a constructor (or member function) that has a parameter with the same name as a member variable, you can disambiguate them by using “this”:

```cpp
class Something
{
private:
    int data;

public:
    Something(int data)
    {
        this->data = data; // this->data is the member, data is the local parameter
    }
};
```

COPY

Note that our constructor is taking a parameter of the same name as a member variable. In this case, “data” refers to the parameter, and “this->data” refers to the member variable. Although this is acceptable coding practice, we find using the “m_” prefix on all member variable names provides a better solution by preventing duplicate names altogether!

Some developers prefer to explicitly add this-> to all class members. We recommend that you avoid doing so, as it tends to make your code less readable for little benefit. Using the m_ prefix is a more readable way to differentiate member variables from non-member (local) variables.

# Chaining member functions

Second, it can sometimes be useful to have a class member function return the object it was working with as a return value. The primary reason to do this is to allow a series of member functions to be “chained” together, so several member functions can be called on the same object! You’ve actually been doing this for a long time. Consider this common example where you’re outputting more than one bit of text using std::cout:

```cpp
std::cout << "Hello, " << userName;
```

COPY

In this case, std::cout is an object, and operator<< is a member function that operates on that object. The compiler evaluates the above snippet like this:

```cpp
(std::cout << "Hello, ") << userName;
```

COPY

First, operator<< uses std::cout and the string literal “Hello, ” to print “Hello, ” to the console. However, since this is part of an expression, operator<< also needs to return a value (or void). If operator<< returned void, you’d end up with this:

```cpp
(void) << userName;
```

COPY

which clearly doesn’t make any sense (and the compiler would throw an error). Instead, operator<< returns *this, which in this context is the std::cout object. That way, after the first operator<< has been evaluated, we get:

```cpp
(std::cout) << userName;
```

COPY

which then prints the user’s name.

In this way, we only need to specify the object (in this case, std::cout) once, and each function call passes it on to the next function to work with, allowing us to chain multiple commands together.

We can implement this kind of behavior ourselves. Consider the following class:

```cpp
class Calc
{
private:
    int m_value{0};

public:

    void add(int value) { m_value += value; }
    void sub(int value) { m_value -= value; }
    void mult(int value) { m_value *= value; }

    int getValue() { return m_value; }
};
```

COPY

If you wanted to add 5, subtract 3, and multiply by 4, you’d have to do this:

```cpp
#include <iostream>

int main()
{
    Calc calc{};
    calc.add(5); // returns void
    calc.sub(3); // returns void
    calc.mult(4); // returns void

    std::cout << calc.getValue() << '\n';
    return 0;
}
```

COPY

However, if we make each function return *this, we can chain the calls together. Here is the new version of Calc with “chainable” functions:

```cpp
class Calc
{
private:
    int m_value{};

public:
    Calc& add(int value) { m_value += value; return *this; }
    Calc& sub(int value) { m_value -= value; return *this; }
    Calc& mult(int value) { m_value *= value; return *this; }

    int getValue() { return m_value; }
};
```

COPY

Note that add(), sub() and mult() are now returning *this. Consequently, this allows us to do the following:

```cpp
#include <iostream>

int main()
{
    Calc calc{};
    calc.add(5).sub(3).mult(4);

    std::cout << calc.getValue() << '\n';
    return 0;
}
```

COPY

We have effectively condensed three lines into one expression! Let’s take a closer look at how this works.

First, calc.add(5) is called, which adds 5 to our m_value. add() then returns *this, which is just a reference to calc, so calc will be the object used in the subsequent evaluation. Next calc.sub(3) evaluates, which subtracts 3 from m_value and again returns calc. Finally, calc.mult(4) multiplies m_value by 4 and returns calc, which isn’t used further, and is thus ignored.

Since each function modified calc as it was executed, calc’s m_value now contains the value (((0 + 5) - 3) * 4), which is 8.

# Summary

==The “this” pointer is a hidden parameter implicitly added to any non-static member function.== Most of the time, you will not need to access it directly, but you can if needed. It’s worth noting that “this” is a const pointer -- you can change the value of the underlying object it points to, but you can not make it point to something else!

By having functions that would otherwise return void return *this instead, you can make those functions chainable. This is most often used when overloading operators for your classes (something we’ll talk about more in [chapter 14](https://www.learncpp.com/#Chapter14)).
